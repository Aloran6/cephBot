# discordbot
  
  A simple discord bot for use with me and my friends. I'm using this as a project to help me learn and practice the go programming language. Currently the bot can only do a few things I will continue to tacle the feature list below but between school and life I'm not sure how much time or how often this will be updated. I will not be releasing a join link for the bot because I frankly don't have the infrastructure to support the bot on more servers than just the few I have with my friends but if you want you can build the bot on your own machine and run it for your own servers that way.

## Things I'll be adding sometime in the Future:

  meme repository
  
  big emoji
  
  music playing
  
  urban dictionary lookup
  
## Built with
  
  [Discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) - The discord API library for go
  
## Special Thanks to:

  [Strum355](https://github.com/Strum355/2Bot-Discord-Bot) For allowing me to look at the source code for his '2bot' for learning the discord API
  
  [The discord gophers server](https://discord.gg/5uKc5Tx) For all their help in my fumblings in the dark with this new language and API
